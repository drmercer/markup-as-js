# Markup As JS
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/markup-as-js.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/markup-as-js)

A tiny, no-dependency library that provides simple functions for creating DOM nodes. Inspired by Flutter's ["UI as Code"](https://medium.com/dartlang/making-dart-a-better-language-for-ui-f1ccaf9f546c) initiative.

## Installation
```
npm install --save markup-as-js
```

## Example Usage
```js
import { div, p, b } from 'markup-as-js';

let el = div(
  {class: "foobar"}, //This is a set of key-value pairs representing the attributes of this node
  p(
    "I ", //String children are automatically converted to TextNodes
    b(
      "really"
    ), 
    " like cheese ðŸ§€"
  )
);

console.log(el);
```
The above snippet creates an HTMLElement containing the following:
```html
<div class="foobar"><p>I <b>really</b> like cheese ðŸ§€</p></div>
```

## Observables and Thenables
Observables (things that implement `.subscribe()`) and Thenables (things that implement `.then()`, like ES6 Promises) can be passed as node children or attribute values.

For Observables, when the value is updated, the DOM node or attribute that the observable was passed to will be updated. This facilitates reactive programming. For example:

```
const counter = new SimpleObservable(0);
const isTen = new SimpleObservable(false);
counter.subscribe(v => isTen.set(v === 10));

return div(
  p(
    counter,
  ),
  button(
    {
      onclick: () => counter.set(counter.value + 1),
      disabled: isTen,
    },
    "Increment"
  ),
);
```

(SimpleObservable is a class provided by this library that is, unsurprisingly, a simple observable. It has `subscribe` and `set` methods, and the constructor takes the initial value.)
